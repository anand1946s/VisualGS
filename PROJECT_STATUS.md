# VisualGS – Project Status

Status: CORE ENGINE COMPLETE  
Phase: Freeze (v0.1)

The following subsystems are considered stable:
- Telemetry replay engine
- Live serial ingestion
- Packet validation & classification
- Derived metrics (altitude, velocity)
- Terminal flight monitor UI
- Plot generation

Future work intentionally deferred:
- GPS integration
- Colorized UI
- Arrow-key navigation
- Web dashboard

This project can be safely cloned and extended later.
